SpellReplay is a TBC/WotLK AddOn that was originally made for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mopalol">Sbkzor</a> in order to backport a retail addon widely used by streamers called TrufiGCD. The AddOn scrolls smoothly and speeds up when multiple spells are used at the same time, making it easier to highlight good plays.
   
It has been built from scratch to also include:
- Missed spells (announced on the frame, in chat and /party for the important ones)
- Applied poison from Shiv
- First reflected spell from Spell Reflection
- First resisted spell from Cloak of Shadows

More features and options will be added soon. (You can access those from Interface > AddOns > SpellReplay)
