SpellReplay is a TBC/WotLK AddOn that was originally made for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mopalol">Sbkzor</a> in order to backport a retail addon widely used by streamers called TrufiGCD. The AddOn scrolls smoothly and speeds up when multiple spells are used at the same time, making it easier to highlight good plays.
   
It has been built from scratch to also include:
- Missed spells (announced on the frame, in chat and /party for the important ones)
- Applied poison from Shiv
- First reflected spell from Spell Reflection
- First resisted spell from Cloak of Shadows

You can currently change its size, scrolling direction and also enable/disable the display of missed spells. You can access those settings from Interface > AddOns > SpellReplay.

## How to install
- Click on the green button "Clone or download"
- Select Download ZIP
- Extract this .zip file under Your_WoW_Directory\Interface\AddOns\
- Remove the "-master" from the folder name
- Enable it from the AddOns list on the Character Selection (it is disabled by default)
